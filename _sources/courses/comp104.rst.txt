Description
--------------------


Computer animation of multimedia objects is increasingly used in web
publishing and in projects for product marketing. The purpose of this
course is to introduce interactive elements in multimedia creation using
computer animation and using simple programming components for
interactivity. The course will teach techniques to create dynamic and
interactive content using Macromediaâ€™s Flash software. Examples of
interactivity include the ability to change the animation upon user
input, as in a flying plane unveiling a banner when the user touches it
or upon the expiration of a timer, as in rain turning to snow in 5
seconds or other event-driven systems. The course is appropriate for
anyone who is interested in using computers to design, and publish
simple graphical animations including web developers, and graphic
artists. The salient feature of the course is that very little
programming knowledge is needed although students should be comfortable
in using software tools and be able to think logically to write simple,
programming segments in a special language called Actionscript.

Outcome
---------------------

Ability to publish created animated media projects to the web in a process that involves understanding human interface design.

Prerequisites
------------------------------

|math118| or Placement or :doc:`../courses/comp125` or :doc:`../courses/comp150` or :doc:`../courses/comp163` or permission. Experience programming in a procedural or object-oriented language recommended.

Description
--------------------

This course is an introduction to the computer science major, covering
basic concepts using the C# (C-Sharp) object-oriented(OO) programming
language.

The course addresses the following questions:

-  What is an algorithm?
-  How does one write, debug, run (“execute”), and test an effective
   computer program?
-  How does one convert an algorithm into a computer program?
-  How does one judge a program?
-  What does “object-oriented” mean?

Topics include: variables, data types,input/output, loops and
repetition, choice, arrays, subprograms,classes/objects, OO principles,
and recursion.

Course Goals
---------------------

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

#. Write good programs of small to medium size – programs that are
   correct, high quality, and use correct and appropriate Object
   Oriented Programming techniques.
#. Reuse classes and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) developed
   by others, especially the standard library APIs.
#. Understand and recognize proper programming style and demonstrate
   making design decisions consistent with Object Oriented
   methodologies.
#. Be able to read, understand, and interpret programs written by others
   in the same language.

Outcome
---------------------

Ability to take a problem, break it into parts, specify algorithms, and express a solution in terms of variables, data types, input/output, repetition, choice, arrays, subprograms, classes, and objects; ability to judge a good program.

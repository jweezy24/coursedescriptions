COMP 271: Data Structures
=========================

This course introduces key data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, as well as their implementations. Performance and analysis of algorithms are covered along with applications in sorting and searching.

Credit Hours

3

Prerequisites
------------------------------

:doc:`../courses/comp170` or :doc:`../courses/comp215`

Co-requisites
------------------------
:doc:`../courses/comp163` or |math201| (corequisite or prerequisite) or declared Computer Science, Computer Crime & Forensics or Information Technology Minor


Description
--------------------

This continuation of :doc:`../courses/comp170` introduces the concepts of data
abstraction and data structure, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and
trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as Java
are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and
searching techniques are analyzed. The concepts of correctness and efficiency
of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms
with recursive algorithms are made. The course includes several major
programming projects. A weekly lab component is required.

Outcome
----------------------

Students will learn to design new data structures as well as learn to use existing data structures in applications.

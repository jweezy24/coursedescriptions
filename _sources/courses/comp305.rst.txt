Description
--------------------

Businesses and scientific institutions have started using commercial grade
database servers increasingly. Hence it has become important to install,
configure, and manage the servers in an efficient manner to increase
productivity. A number of tasks involved in maintaining a database server is
quite different from say administering a computer system or a network. Deeper
knowledge of the storage aspects of the server and how different server
processes work are needed for successful administration of the server.
Typically, the database administrator cares for security of data, backup and
recovery, and space management. This course takes a user through the stages of
setting up a database server environment, to design of a database, and finally
tuning.

Outcome
----------------------

Students will be able to use theory and pragmatic approaches to define and implement realistic solutions for large database administration environments.

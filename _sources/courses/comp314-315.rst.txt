COMP 314/315: Problem Solving Strategies
========================================

This course allows students to sharpen problem-solving skills along with, 
or as part of, the ACM Programming Team. 
Groups generally work on old competition problems on alternate weekends, 
with short follow-ups during the next week.

COMP 314: Problem Solving Strategies

Description
--------------------

This course started as a means to give ACM programing team members
academic credit for their participation. The class work will be designed
to help these people. We will mostly work old programming team
competition problems, alone and in groups, and discuss strategies for
solving such problems effectively. You do not need to be interested in
the official team to find these problems and the discussions about them
interesting. You do NOT need to agree to be on the team to be in the
class. You are welcomed to be in the class if you just want to sharpen
your problem solving and triaging skills.  
The competition problems are reasonable
ones to work on with or without the competition. They are are quite
unlike typical course homework exercises:  They come from all different areas,
all different levels of difficulty, and the words describing them do not 
directly say any algorithm needed. A significant part of each 
problem is to classify it.  Advanced students will certainly find challenging
problems to work on.  Students in Comp 271 should find enough to keep them
productively occupied, and get a taste of more advanced techniques from 
class discussions. 

If you *do* want to compete officially, see also 
http://anh.cs.luc.edu/314-315/prog-team.html.

By enrolling in the sequence 314-315 over two years, you satisfy 3 units
of elective credit in Computer Science department majors.

In keeping with the programming competition format, we will arrange a
schedule to meet about every two weekends for a 5 hour practice/problem
solving session, with a weekday followup discussion for 1-1.5 hours on a
weekday in the following week.

The organizational meeting to agree on practice and discussion times
will be in the afternoon in the first week of classes. The time will be
posted.

Contact Dr. Harrington if you cannot attend that session. Try to let him
know ahead of time your available weekend times through October.

Outcome
----------------------

Ability to work in small groups, quickly and accurately assessing and solving focused problems involving many sorts of programming knowledge.

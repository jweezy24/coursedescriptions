The course has been structured to provide logical groupings of common technologies, which complement each other in the development of games and games-based applications.

As such, this course will offer a combination of technical concepts and development, awareness of aesthetic requirements, and cultural perspectives inherently necessary to create well-rounded, performant games and gaming environments.

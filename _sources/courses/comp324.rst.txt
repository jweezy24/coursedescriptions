Description
----------------------------

This course studies the design, development, and publication of client-side web applications.

Students will acquire an awareness of different client-side design and development methods, technologies, and techniques suitable for the development of web applications.

The course has been structured to provide logical groupings of common technologies, which complement each other in the development of modern client-side applications. The student will begin by developing fundamental skills and knowledge in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and JSON. This allows a student to then progress to the more advanced implementations of current client-side technologies including React, D3.js, and other suitable JS based libraries.

We shall also consider client-side usage of tools and technologies such as Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. These technologies will be considered primarily from the client-side perspective with complementary introductions to data stores such as Redis, MongoDB, and Firebase.

Description
--------------------

Codes with algebraic structure for error control are examined. Block codes including Hamming codes
and Reed-Muller codes, BCH codes, and other cyclic codes with algebraic structure and their implementation
are treated. Other topics may include: convolutional codes, efficiency considerations, and Shannon's
fundamental theorem of information theory.

Outcome
-------------

Students will learn both the theory and application of error-correcting codes.

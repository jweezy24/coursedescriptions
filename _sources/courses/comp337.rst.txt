COMP 337: Introduction to Concurrency
=====================================

Many real-world software systems rely on concurrency for performance and modularity.  This programming-intensive course covers analysis, design, implementation, and testing of concurrent software systems.

Description
--------------------

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of
concurrent software systems. Process algebras, formal specification, and
testing are used as tools in the engineering of concurrent systems;
event-based programming frameworks and thread libraries are employed in
the implementation of such systems. Coursework includes several
substantial programming projects (in a language such as Java) involving
applications of concurrency and event-driven programming such as
graphical user interfaces and distributed services using Remote Method
Invocation (RMI).

Outcome
--------------------

An in-depth understanding of event-based and thread-based views of concurrency; the ability to develop concurrent software components
using suitable languages, frameworks, and design patterns; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and development tools and test
driven development.

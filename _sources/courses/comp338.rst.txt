COMP 338: Server-Based Software Development
============================================

Server-based web applications and services have become part of everyday life. 
This programming-intensive course covers analysis, design, implementation, and 
testing of multi-tiered server-based software systems along with typical tier-specific technologies.

Description
--------------------

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of
multi-tiered server-based software systems. Each tier is studied along
with the pertinent mechanisms: markup languages in the client tier, web
application frameworks in the web tier, and server-side components in
the business logic and persistence tiers. Pervasive issues such as
integration, testing, security, and performance are discussed.
Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (using a
platform such as Java 2 Enterprise Edition).

Outcome
----------

An understanding of software architecture and integration in the development of 
multi-tiered server-based software; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and 
development tools and test-driven development.

Description
--------------------

This course surveys the construction of modern packet-switched networks, focusing on TCP/IP. At the LAN layer, protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi are described. At the IP layer, a variety of routing-update protocols are studied. At the Transport layer, the course addresses the creation of end-to-end reliability and the management of network-wide congestion. The course also introduces basic issues in network security and in real-time communications. Some programming, generally in a language like Java or C#, may be required.

Outcome
---------

Students will understand how the Internet is constructed, how data is routed to its destination, how connections are made, how congestion is handled, and how security can be addressed.

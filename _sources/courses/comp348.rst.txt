Description
--------------------

This course will involve a discussion of the methods and tactics used to
keep attackers at bay as well as the mechanisms by which we can identify
and potentially stop potential "bad guys." It will involve the following
topics as they all relate to the overall security posture which makes
computing safer: Encryption, authentication, firewalls, NAT/PAT,
restricted access policies, intrusion detection and other security
frameworks. The goal is to gain an understanding of how to secure
computers and computing environments. Instructor permission is based on
relevant industry experience with networking including TCP/IP.

Outcome
----------

An understanding of how to secure networks using encryption, authentication, firewalls, NAT/PAT, restricted access policies, intrusion detection and other security frameworks.

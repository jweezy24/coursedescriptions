Description
----------------------------

The tool of simulation is probably the most useful tool for analyzing problems
which arise in real applications which are much too complicated to be analyzed
mathematically. One example is the study of inventory control policies. When
should the inventory be checked? How many units should be ordered? What are
the anticipated consequences of these decisions? We simulate the random
character of the demand for the product and the delay in receiving orders of
the product. The objective is to provide management with relevant information
for constructing an acceptable inventory policy.

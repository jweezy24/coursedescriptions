COMP 364: High-Performance Computing
====================================

This course covers parallel architectures and parallel models of computation.  Algorithms for achieving high performance in various computational contexts are discussed.  Models such as shared memory, message passing, and hybrid modes of computing are introduced.

Description
--------------------

This course is motivated by the realization that cpu speeds are
levelling off at between 3GHz and 5GHz. The need for programs to be
faster and more efficient is all the more important at a time when
applications are getting increasingly larger and more complex. We will
introduce techniques to gain performance boost in Java programs and C++
(or C) programs by discussing the use of multiple processors.

This course makes use of departmental HPC resources. Please see
the Systems Handbook at http://syshandbook.cs.luc.edu for details 
about our various HPC computing systems and partner resources.

Outcome
---------

Students will learn how to engineer solutions to practical problems in multiprocessor architectures and using large physical memories.

Description
--------------------

In this programming intensive course, students will learn effective
automation, testing, and use of software metrics through the practices
of Test Driven Development and Continuous Deployment. The first half of
the course will focus on the fundamentals of Test Driven Development and
test automation. The second half of the course will build upon those
skills and allow the students to create acceptance test and deployment
automation tools. Finally, students will learn how to measure user
feedback effectively, thereby allowing them to safely deploy changes to
running production software multiple times per day, rather than once
every few weeks or months.

After taking this course, students should be able to:

-  Employ Test Driven Development to create automated unit tests and
   improve the design of software.
-  Create tools for build, test, and deployment automation.
-  Understand the benefits and costs of automated acceptance testing.
-  Use automated tests and metrics to address cross-cutting concerns
   such as performance and scalability.
-  Possess the basic skills necessary to create, test, deploy, and
   maintain an application written for a cloud computing environment.

Outcome
----------

Students will learn how to prevent errors, how to get 'bugs' out of software, and be able to apply this knowledge in other courses and projects.

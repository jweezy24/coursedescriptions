COMP 373: Objects, Frameworks, and Patterns
===========================================

Object-orientation continues to be a dominant approach to software development.  This advanced programming-intensive course studies object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation from a design patterns perspective.

Prerequisites
------------------------------

:doc:`../courses/comp313`

You need to have knowledge of Java, C# or a similar object-oriented language, data
structures, and fair sophistication with OOP - some experience with
designing interacting, cooperating classes that would come in an
intermediate discussion of software patterns. Software engineering is
recommended but not required like the background listed above.

Description
--------------------

Object-oriented programming has become the dominant software development
paradigm of the 1990s. This course assumes familiarity with the main
constituents of the object-oriented methodology:

-   OOP = abstraction + inheritance + polymorphism

Building on this foundation, the course studies three major topics:

**Design Patterns**

First, the course discusses patterns, reusable solutions to recurring
software design problems. Common design patterns such as Composite,
Decorator, and Command typically involve several classes related by
composition and inheritance.

**Implementation**

Next, the course examines how object-oriented language features such as
composition, encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic binding can be
implemented. These features are studied in the context of an interpreter
for a simplified object-oriented language.

**Components**

Finally, the course explores programming with reusable components.
Specifically, the standard features of component architectures are
discussed: properties, events, methods, and persistence, and
introspection. 

Other Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This course is heavily project-oriented. Students study each major
topic in the context of a substantial programming project. The reuse of
existing class libraries and software components is emphasized.

Grading will be based upon the following components: programming
projects, quizzes, in-class exams, and the final exam.

Outcome
------------

Proficiency in the use of object-oriented languages, frameworks, and patterns; advanced understanding of key language mechanisms such as delegation, inheritance, polymorphism, and reflection; familiarity with object-oriented modeling and development tools and test-driven development.

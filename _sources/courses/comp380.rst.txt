COMP 380: Introduction to Computer Graphics
===========================================

This course introduces modern theory and practices in 3-D computer graphics, stressing real-time interactive applications using libraries like OpenGL. 

Credit Hours

Prerequisites
------------------------------

:doc:`../courses/comp271`

The requirements for the course are some familiarity with C or C++,
basic linear algebra (matrices and vector geometry), and differential
calculus.

Description
--------------------

Computer graphics is the art and science of producing images using a
computer. We will study the theory of computer graphics, in particular
3D rendering, while gaining a working knowledge of the OpenGL graphics
library. Much of the computer graphics we see in the media was created
using software based on the Open GL graphics library, which has quickly
become an industry standard.

A word of warning-computer graphics makes considerable use of
mathematics-elementary linear algebra, vector analysis and differential
calculus.

Other Information

There will be 7-8 programming assignments, a midterm, and a final. You
will probably do your assignments using Visual C++ under either Windows
95 or Windows NT.

Outcome
----------------

Student will learn how to program real-time interactive applications using libraries like OpenGL.

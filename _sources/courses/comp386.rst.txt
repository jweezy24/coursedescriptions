COMP 150 or COMP 170 or Instructor Consent

Description
--------------------

Introduces computational methods to understand neural processing in the brain. Levels of representation from low-level, temporally precise neural circuits to systems-level rate-encoded models, to information-theoretic approaches. Emphasis on sensory systems, primarily vision and audition, most readily demonstrating the need for such computational techniques.


Outcome
-------------

Appreciation that many aspects of neuroscience cannot be understood without appropriate mathematical or computational frameworks, and ability to adeptly apply these frameworks in the various domains of neuroscience.

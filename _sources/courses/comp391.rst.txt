COMP 391: Internship in Computer Science
========================================

Students work outside the classroom applying and extending their computer science skills, typically for at least 150 hours for 3 credits.  A memorandum of understanding is required between a student, his or her employer, and the Undergraduate Program Director, followed by final reports from the student and the employer.

Credits
--------------------

Variable, 1-6

Prerequisites
-----------------------

Undergraduate Internship Coordinator approval (usually limited to 6 total credits).

Description
--------------------

An opportunity to obtain experience in software development, design,
or related activities in computer science in a professional setting.

Selection for Internships in Computer Science:

#. Students interested in internship must first find an
   employer/supervisor willing to provide them with a job.  Internships
   are most advantageous to students if they already have considerable
   experience in upper level Computer Science courses.  Skills from
   upper level courses are also going to help students be hired.
#. The student must make a formal request to the Undergraduate
   Internship Coordinator, supplying a job Description.
   The Undergraduate Internship Coordinator is looking for positions
   where the student will use and extend knowledge from upper level
   courses.
#. The Undergraduate Internship Coordinator reviews the student's
   performance in general and in relevant Comp classes, and either
   approves the request or suggests what further steps the student
   should make before securing an internship.
#. By the start of the internship the student must deliver the
   Internship Memorandum of Understanding (see below) signed by both the
   supervisor, student, and Undergraduate Internship Coordinator,
   outlining the expectations of all parties.

Presently the standard expectation is 50 hours of work relevant to a
computer science education for each unit of credit. Hence 150 hours are
expected for 3 credits. Work may overlap terms, and then credit is
offered for the term in which the internship is completed. For more
formal details, please see the Computer Science Internship Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU), in `PDF
format <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_4VraMwHUoVjFWYU1sVW9NdTA/edit?usp=sharing>`__
or in `MS-Word
format <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_4VraMwHUod3dsWFA0bWc5WFU/edit?usp=sharing>`__.

Note 1: This is a course like any other where you need to be
registered on time for the term (fall semester, spring semester, or
summer) in which the internship will end. Many people have been denied
registration for 391 because they tried to register late, concentrating
on the job, not the registration. Also you must get the approval of
the Undergraduate Internship Coordinator first. Plan ahead.

Note 2: In order to get a grade recorded, the final reports of the
student and the employer must be received by the Undergraduate
Internship Coordinator before the last week of the finals week. Make
sure the end date on the internship is early enough to fit with that.
You may continue with more hours in your job after the for-credit
internship part.

Note 3: You do not need to be classified as an "intern" in your job.
It can be a regular job. The internship only comes from the relationship
to your academic credit and the supporting documents indicated in the
MOU. The overhead for the employer is comparable to a letter of
recommendation.

Internship opportunities that the Computer Science Department has
received are posted here and in the department on the fourth floor of
Lewis Towers. Another resource is the `university career and internship
center <http://www.luc.edu/career/>`__. Students may also find a
position through their own contacts.

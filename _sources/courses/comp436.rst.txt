Description
----------------------------

This course covers Extensible Markup Language (XML) and its applications. This
course will cover the core XML component frameworks, including XSLT (a
transformational approach) and the various W3C specifications for manipulating
XML documents programmatically, including the DOM and SAX frameworks. As well,
this course will cover some advanced topics, including how to manage large XML
documents and integration with databases. Please note that HTML will be
occasionally used in this course; however, this course is not about HTML and
students may want to acquire an HTML book and study it briefly before taking
this course. This course is not about making cool web pages. The course has
almost nothing to do with web pages and is focused more on modeling and the
emergent notion of web services.

Students should expect the programming to be somewhat involved (intermediate
to advanced). Most of the programming is based on straightforward data
structures, such as trees, lists, and maps (collections found in Java). You
are encouraged to study these topics on your own. Little time will be spent
rehashing this preliminary knowledge.

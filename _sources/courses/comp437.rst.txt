Description
----------------------------

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of concurrent
software systems. Process algebras, formal specification, and testing are used
as tools in the engineering of concurrent systems; event-based programming
frameworks and thread libraries are employed in the implementation of such
systems. Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (in a
language such as Java) involving applications of concurrency and event-driven
programming such as graphical user interfaces and distributed services using
Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

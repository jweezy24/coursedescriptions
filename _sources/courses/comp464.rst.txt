Description
----------------------------

This course is motivated by the realization that cpu speeds are levelling off
at between 3GHz and 5GHz. The need for programs to be faster and more
efficient is all the more important at a time when applications are getting
increasingly larger and more complex. We will introduce techniques to gain
performance boost in Java programs and C++ (or C) programs by discussing the
use of multiple processors. This course will use two kinds of hardware
platforms we have in the department, two IBM symmetric multiprocessors with 4
CPUs each and 4 GB of memory and a cluster of AMD machines all running Linux.
We will study shared memory (OpenMP), message passing (MPI) and hybrid models
of programming the high-performance machines. This course will use a blend of
foundational understanding as well as a set of practical tools to gain insight
into performance engineering of software.

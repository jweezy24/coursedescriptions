Prerequisites

:doc:`../courses/comp413` or :doc:`../courses/comp313`

You need to have knowledge of Java, C# or a similar object-oriented language,
data structures, and fair sophistication with OOP - some experience with
designing interacting, cooperating classes that would come in an intermediate
discussion of software patterns. Software engineering is recommended but not
required like the background listed above.


Description
----------------------------

Object-oriented programming has become the dominant software development
paradigm of the 1990s. This course assumes familiarity with the main
constituents of the object-oriented methodology:

-   OOP = abstraction + inheritance + polymorphism

Building on this foundation, the course studies three major topics:

**Design Patterns**

First, the course discusses patterns, reusable solutions to recurring software
design problems. Common design patterns such as Composite, Decorator, and
Command typically involve several classes related by composition and
inheritance.

**Implementation**

Next, the course examines how object-oriented language features such as
composition, encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic binding can be
implemented. These features are studied in the context of an interpreter for a
simplified object-oriented language.

**Components**

Finally, the course explores programming with reusable components.
Specifically, the standard features of component architectures are discussed:
properties, events, methods, and persistence, and introspection.

Other Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This course is heavily project-oriented. Students study each major topic in
the context of a substantial programming project. The reuse of existing class
libraries and software components is emphasized.  Grading will be based upon
the following components: programming projects, quizzes, in-class exams, and
the final exam.

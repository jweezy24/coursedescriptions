Description
----------------------------

This course will study three mutually related topics: languages, machines, and
computability. The mathematical ideas developed in this course are useful in
many areas of computer science, including the design and specification of
programming languages, construction of compilers, and exploring the
capabilities and limitations of mechanical computation. This subject is
important for the scientific foundations it lays for computer science, for the
philosophical concerns it raises about the nature of computation, and for the
sheer elegance it brings in to the studies related to a variety of
applications. Some of the most fundamental discoveries in computer science
identify connections among languages, machines, and computability.
Furthermore, some of the most challenging questions at the heart of computer
science also arise from these topics. The course will cover a majority of the
following topics: regular languages, finite automata, determinism and
nondeterminism in finite automata, applications to searching and pattern
matching, context-free languages, push-down automata, applications to compiler
design, computability theory, Church-Turing thesis, Turing machines,
undecidability, recursive and recursively enumerable languages, reductions
among languages, resource-bounded computation, Kolmogorov complexity.

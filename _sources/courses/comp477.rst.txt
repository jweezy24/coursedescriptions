Description
----------------------------

This course is an introduction to the philosophy and practice of project
management. The course involves a student group project to investigate and
plan a “real world” project. The investigation requires application of
project-management tools covered in the class, including a project proposal
that specifies project objectives, schedules, work breakdown structure, and
responsibilities, an written interim report, and a final oral and written
report. The course will likely include both business and computer science
students working together on a student team.

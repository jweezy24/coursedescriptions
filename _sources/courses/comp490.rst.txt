COMP 490: Independent Project
=======================================================

Credit Hours
-----------------------------------

Variable (1-6)

Prerequisites
----------------------------

Previous agreement of a Computer Science faculty supervisor

Description
----------------------------

An independent project in computer science or related disciplines, under the
supervision of a member of faculty.

Students may not register themselves. A request with the exact semester and
number of units must be forwarded by the faculty supervisor, after an
agreement is made with the student.

A good feature of an independent project is that you can make your transcript
show a course title that is specific to your particular project. Fill out the
`Request for Course Title form <http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf>`_, and get the signature of your supervisor and
the gpd. More information can be found in the `Graduate Program Handbook <http://gradhandbook.cs.luc.edu/html/regulations.html#independent-study>`_.

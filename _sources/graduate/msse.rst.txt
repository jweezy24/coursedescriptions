M.S. in Software Engineering
============================

Overview
---------

The M.S. in Software Engineering caters to students interested in software engineering 
and also other contemporary topics of long-term value to the industry. 
Most early careers in the industry are based on either software development or 
managerial aspects of software development. 
This degree places more weight on software development. 
For those seeking a greater focus on managerial aspects, we offer the 
:doc:`msit`.

Curriculum
----------

This program is for students entering the program in Spring 2014 or later.
If you were enrolled in the program prior to Spring 2014 you may use the older
degree requirements located at `here <http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/msse/oldcurriculum/>`_.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Software Engineering
students must complete the following:

*   Two (2) required courses addressing ethical and social issues in the 
    computing field and a firm base in object oriented programming.
*   Three (3) courses from restricted categories to ensure a strong 
    software engineering center, while still allowing a considerable 
    flexibility of interests.
*   Five (5) courses or 15 credits that are general electives.

Major Requirements (6 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   :doc:`../courses/comp413` (prereq to some other courses - take early!)
*   :doc:`../courses/comp417`

Restricted Electives (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSSE students must take at least one course from the following Group 1 list:

Group 1
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp424`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp433`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp434`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp437`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp439`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp442`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp460` (note special prereq, :doc:`../courses/comp363` )
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp471`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp473`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp474` 

Most of these Group 1 courses require :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.
Excepetions are Comp 424, 474 and 460.

MSSE students must also take two additional courses from either the list above 
or the following Group 2 list:

Group 2
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp410`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp412`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp420`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp436`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp441`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp453`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp464`

If a student enters the program with an academic record of success in a 
course similar to :doc:`../courses/comp413`, or if the student can demonstrate 
programming experience with the concepts of :doc:`../courses/comp413`, 
then the Graduate Program Director may substitute for the :doc:`../courses/comp413`
requirement a course in Group 1 or 2 that has :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.

The Computer Science department may declare that other courses 
(eg new courses and individual :doc:`../courses/comp488` offerings) 
may count as members of either Group 1 or Group 2.

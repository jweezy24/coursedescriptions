BS/MS Dual Degree Programs
==============================

Overview
--------

The BS/MS programs in Information Technology, Software Engineering, 
and Computer Science are five-year programs that give academically successful 
Loyola undergraduates the opportunity to pursue the MS degree in 
Information Technology, Software Engineering, 
or Computer Science while completing their BS degree. 
The applicant can be pursuing any of the BS degrees offered by the 
Department of Computer Science, including the joint majors with Mathematics 
or Physics or the interdisciplinary Bioinformatics.

These programs reduce the total number of courses needed and the 
total time needed for the combined degrees.

Students may not automatically enroll in the BS/MS program 
during Freshman admission. They must specifically apply to the Graduate School, 
generally in their Junior year by using 
`The Graduate Application Form <https://gpem.luc.edu/apply/>`__. 
See :ref:`application_requirements` and 
:ref:`application_information` for more details.

Curriculum
----------

.. Students entering before Spring 2014 may choose instead to follow the 
   previous requirements located here, though the new version is generally more flexible.

The stand-alone MS programs each require 30 credits of graduate courses. 
This generally takes one and a half years to complete. 
BS/MS students must also take 30 credits of courses at the 
400 level or greater. The main advantages come from the fact that 
some of the MS courses may be double counted, applying to the BS also, 
and there can be a shift in some of the required MS courses based on what 
students took in the BS portion. In particular students in the BS/MS 
program are allowed to “double count” 9 credits 
(generally three 3-credit courses) of their Loyola COMP courses for 
both their BS and MS degrees. Each must be a 400 level course taken 
in the student's senior year *in place* of a 300 level major course. 
In addition, a student wishing to take 123 or more credits 
while an undergraduate, can have 3 of the extra credits 
be for a fourth 400 level COMP course, and count that toward the MS 
if the extra course is need for *no* undergraduate requirement, from the
university, college, core, major or minor.
Hence a BS/MS student with 120 credits and 9 400-level COMP credits 
counted for the BS is required to take only 21 credits 
(instead of 30 credits) of additional 400-level courses. 
If a student takes a further 3-credit 400 level COMP course beyond the 
120 credits needed for the BS, then only 18 further credits are needed. 
In either case students can finish the program in five years. 
Some further special rules:

#.   All students need to take :doc:`../courses/comp271` 
     as part of their undergraduate major.
#.   Students pursuing an MS in Software Engineering or Computer Science 
     must take :doc:`../courses/comp313` by their senior year.
#.   Students may take at most 6 credits total of internship at the 
     undergraduate and graduate level, :doc:`../courses/comp391` plus :doc:`../courses/comp499`.
#.   A student with credit for a 300 level COMP course that was taught 
     in a combined class with a 400 level course may not take the 
     400 level course later for separate credit without permission from 
     the Graduate Program Director. In particular for students with credit 
     for :doc:`../courses/comp317`, the MS requirement for :doc:`../courses/comp417` is waived, 
     to be replaced by 3 MS elective credits. 
     Similarly, in programs requiring :doc:`../courses/comp413`, :doc:`../courses/comp313` will 
     satisfy the requirement, but still the course will need to be replaced 
     by 3 MS elective credits.
#.   In MS programs with restricted electives lists with two or more courses 
     required from a larger explicit list, one of the courses may be waived 
     if the corresponding 300 level undergraduate course was successfully 
     completed at Loyola. The course must still be replaced by a 3-credit 
     MS program elective.
#.   All further individual MS program requirements must be met, 
     but with the inclusion of the allowed 400 level courses taken as an 
     undergraduate.

Application Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The academic prerequisites to be considered for admission to the BS/MS 
programs in the Computer Science Department are as follows:

-   Apply *before the start of your senior (final undergrad) year*.  CAS requires this
    to be clear how to handle your advising for your final undergrad year.
-   Successful completion of a total of at least 15 credits of major 
    COMP courses, including :doc:`../courses/comp271` 
    (even if :doc:`../courses/comp271` is only an elective in the major) and including 
    at least 9 credits of 300 level COMP courses. 
    For students pursuing the BS degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
    Computer Science and Physics, or Bioinformatics, the 300-level courses 
    may alternately include up to 6 credits of 300 level major courses that 
    are not COMP.
-   A GPA of 3.5 or higher in all the major courses.
-   A cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher for all course work at Loyola;
-   Satisfactory progress towards completion of Loyola’s core.

Further notes on BS completion:  Before the undergraduate deadlines do apply to graduate 
with your B.S in the semester you will actually finish!  
Otherwise you complicate the conversion to graduate status.
If the date when you will start graduate status changes from your original
application, notify the GPD ahead of time so data in Locus can be fixed.
  
.. _application_information:

Application Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current Loyola students who have met the above academic prerequisites 
are encouraged to apply before registration opens for your senior year, 
though the program is still of practical help to a student who applies before 
the final undergrad semester in which s/he is taking COMP courses. 
Students who have an interest in the program are encouraged to consult 
with the Graduate Program Director for Computer Science, Dr. Andrew Harrington, 
in the semester prior to their application. 
The application will be evaluated upon completion of the following:

-   `The Graduate Application Form <https://gpem.luc.edu/apply/>`_; 
    applicants are to select the BS/MS option.  Be careful of the
    misleading entry named "starting semester": The 
    *starting semester for the program should be the first semester when the*
    *student will be in pure*  **graduate** *status* (after expected completion
    of the BS).  This is *not* generally the semester coming right after the student 
    has filled out the application.  This is *after* all double-counted
    courses are completed.
-   A one page personal statement of purpose.
-   Three letters of recommendation, at least two coming from faculty 
    in the Department of Computer Science at Loyola University.

Note that the GRE exam is not required for applicants to the BS/MS program, 
even if they are applying for an assistantship. There is no application fee 
for applicants who apply on-line. At the time of consideration for admission, 
the student’s most recent Loyola transcript will be examined. 
If the applicant has transfer credits from another college or university, 
the student may be required to submit those as well.

Requirements for Completion of the BS/MS Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After admission to the BS/MS program, a student may request to be 
registered in their senior year for up to four 400 level COMP courses, 
with three of them replacing undergraduate major courses, and a fourth *if* 
student will graduate with at least 123 credits and not need the fourth course 
as a part of *any* undergraduate requirement. 
Students generally take the remainder of their 30 credits of 400-level 
MS classes during their fifth year. This schedule can be modified for students 
with AP or transfer credit who desire to finish the combined program 
in less than five years. Students in the program are expected to consult 
regularly with the Graduate Program Director to insure that they are on track 
for completion of both the BS and MS degrees. 
The following are required to complete a BS/MS degree program:

*   Successful completion of one of the BS degrees in the Department of 
    Computer Science or Bioinformatics or a joint major with Mathematics or Physics. 
*   The 30 credits of 400-level graduate courses, 
    including those counted while an 
    undergraduate, completed with a GPA of 3.0 or higher

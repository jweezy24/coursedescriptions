B.S. in Physics with Computer Science
=====================================

Overview
---------

Physics is understood in terms of many mathematical relationships that are much easier to state than solve, and computer science has become a major part of many physicists' work to solve enormous problems. This major is preparation for graduate study in physics, applied physics, computer science, and especially in the burgeoning research field of computational physics, as well as in many branches of engineering. Employment opportunities are in industry, R&D and manufacturing, research and teaching in academic institutions, and research in government and private laboratories.

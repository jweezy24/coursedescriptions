Criminal Law
============

Overview
--------

Crimes in general are dealt with using preventive and detective techniques. Computer crime is no different. With the dramatic increase in the use of computers, networks, and the Internet, crimes committed via computers and networks have also risen rather sharply. Computer crime prevention falls in the areas known as computer and network security. Computer crime detection is generally known as computer forensics. Computer forensic investigations deal with white collar crime, telecommunications fraud, network intrusion detection, and criminal procedures. A computer forensic expert can help solve cases in money laundering, intellectual property, child pornography, embezzlement, e-mail harassment, murder, and terrorism.

Computer Crime and Forensics is an interdisciplinary minor of the Computer Science and Criminal Justice Departments that will impart knowledge to students in the areas of criminal justice system, courts, law and procedures, computer software, hardware, networks, and investigative and evidence-gathering protocols.

The Computer Crime and Forensics minor does not require any programming background and will appeal to those who want to use computers to solve criminal or civil cases where the evidence is traceable via a computer network or storage. The minor should particularly appeal to computer science, criminal justice and forensic sciences majors. The minor is open for any Loyola student who has an analytical and investigative mind and who enjoys working with computer tools.

Career Opportunities

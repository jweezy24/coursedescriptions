<p>All students need the equivalent knowledge
of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures</span></a>. The topics for these courses are outlined in
<a class="reference internal" href="#programming-prerequisites"><span class="std std-ref">Two Basic Programming Prerequisites</span></a>.
This knowledge is prerequisite to essentially all
the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department, with the exception of
<a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp417.html"><span class="doc">COMP 417: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing</span></a>.</p>
<p>Students in the Computer Science Graduate Program need the strongest preparation.
Most will have an undergraduate degree or at least the first two years
of foundational undergraduate courses.  This would include the addition of
equivalents of our
<a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp163.html"><span class="doc">COMP 163: Discrete Structures</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp264.html"><span class="doc">COMP 264: Introduction to Computer Systems</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp363.html"><span class="doc">COMP 363: Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</span></a>
to the two courses already listed above.
In particular advanced undergraduate algorithm background is required
before taking the required spring grad course, Comp 460, Algorithms.</p>
<p>Software Engineering students are in the middle.
The background for the Computer Science student is helpful, but adept
transitioning students may manage with the two basic courses
that the IT students need if they perform very well in them.</p>
<p>Many of our best students in Information Technology and Software Engineering
have transitioned from other fields.</p>
<p><strong>You can handle missing prerequisite knowledge in a number of ways</strong>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Take them somewhere else
(possibly cheaper and more convenient to your location,
but possibly not as good or not covering mostly what we want)</li>
<li>Take them at Loyola:  Take just the courses we want, with support of our faculty,
giving you an opportunity to get into our community and build relationships
with faculty and students.<ul>
<li>This can be done before entering the Graduate program as a non-degree undergrad
(cheaper undergraduate tuition).</li>
<li>You can get both prerequisites in one semester with our special compressed
sections (section number 400) of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures</span></a>.
See a fuller discussion below.</li>
<li>The compressed prerequisites can be taken after admission to the
graduate program.  Then you become a full-time
graduate student if you add a third course - a
graduate course not
requiring the prerequisites.
(faster full-time finish!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Compressed prep courses</strong>:
In fall or spring you have the opportunity to take a compressed intensive
sequence of the <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures</span></a> prerequisites in one semester:
two 7-8 weeks courses in succession,
each with the same total contact hours of regular 15 week courses.
To be a full-time graduate student at the same
time, the most common additional course is  the required <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp417.html"><span class="doc">COMP 417: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing</span></a>,
which has no prerequisite.
Note that 6 1/4 hours of class a week in the
compressed prerequisites with
all the work that goes with them does require some dedication!
Many transitioning students with full-time jobs have found this to be
<em>too much</em> to take on even without an additional grad course.  You can see the
speed of topics in the first course in fall 2017
by looking at the course website,
<a class="reference external" href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/170">http://anh.cs.luc.edu/170</a>, where we start with Python from
<a class="reference external" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html</a>
and then have a comparison and brief transition to Java
in preparation for the next course.</p>
<p>Comp 170 does not require any background
in programming, but if you have no background in programming,
then it IS important to have a math background in which you are comfortable
with the material in a
precalculus course like our Math 118, which includes
<em>significant manipulation of functions and logical symbolic progressions</em>.
If you have a previous modest introduction to programming, including
defining and using
functions, then the formal math background is not so important.</p>
<p><em>Students who neither have this math background</em>
<em>nor any programming at all</em> may well want to get a more gentle introduction to
programming first, as in our <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp150.html"><span class="doc">COMP 150: Introduction to Computing</span></a>.  It is offered fall and spring
and online in the summer. If you do need the extra preparation like in Comp 150,
then this will slow you down by a semester.</p>
<p>Please contact the Graduate Program Director with any questions at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gpd&#37;&#52;&#48;cs&#46;luc&#46;edu">gpd<span>&#64;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p>
<p>The next section, <a class="reference internal" href="#programming-prerequisites"><span class="std std-ref">Two Basic Programming Prerequisites</span></a>, lists more details
of material you should know before taking graduate courses in our department.</p>

<span id="programming-prerequisites"></span><span id="index-1"></span><h2>Two Basic Programming Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#two-basic-programming-prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Knowledge of the content below is prerequisite for almost all
of the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department.</p>
<p>The descriptions below are for the courses at Loyola, in a
pretty standard introductory sequence.
If you took these subjects elsewhere, you are not likely to have the exact
same collection of topics, but if you are close,
there should not be much problem filling holes as needed.</p>
